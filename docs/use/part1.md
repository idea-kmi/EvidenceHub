# Introduction to the Evidence Hub

## What is an Evidence Hub?

An Evidence Hub is a website for your community to pool its ideas and debate different kinds of evidence. An Evidence Hub might play a number of roles for a given community, depending on how you use it:

1.  It offers a way to crowdsource a geo-map of who is in the community — a community of people, organizations and projects. The Hub will also generate your own social network visualization based on the people whose contributions to the hub you connect to.

<br />
2.  You can map the issues, claims, solutions, +/– evidence and resources you encounter in your community or domain of interest: a sort of “dashboard” and collectively generated set of concept maps that can help make sense of your community and domain of interest, e.g. _My Issues page_:  
    ![Example My Issues page](/docs/images/evhub-use-part1-b.png)
<br />
3.  It’s offered as a qualitative tool for collaborative enquiry and knowledge mapping, with example learning analytics, e.g. top-level summary of my contributions:

## The Hub’s building blocks

Social media platforms tend to make it as easy as possible to publish with a single click (eg. status updates, photos, comments). This is great for socialising and sharing media fragments, and doesn’t require much thought (as some learn to their cost!).

In contrast, the Hub is designed to slow you down, because it’s dealing with ideas and evidence. You are required to be a little more reflective when you put something on the map, to increase the signal to noise ratio — and the chances that you and others will find what they’re looking for: _What kind of contribution do I have, where does it best fit, and how does it connect to other contributions?_

The Hub’s building blocks or data types for an Evidence Hub are as shown below, a graphic that appears as a navigational cue in the Hub:

Go to the help page and click on the boxes to learn more about these:

![Example Themes](/docs/images/evhub-use-part1-e.png)

Everything is indexed by one or more themes. Themes are specific to each community and will usually appear on the homepage of an Evidence Hub as an intial way into the communities main areas of interest, e.g.:

![Node type Help Page Scren grab](/docs/images/evhub-use-part1-f.png)
Here you can how Evidence Hub content wraps itself around a given Theme as a set of tiled widgets which can be expanded/collapsed to show the details you want, e.g.

## Searching

Naturally everything is searchable, either through free-text or tag-specific search. Do a site-wide search from the top-right field, and see how the results are clustered by type:

![Search box image](/docs/images/evhub-use-part1-h.png)

Search results have a unique URL you can share, e.g. `http://solar.evidence-hub.net/search.php?q=social+network` (no longer an existing site). 

Example search results:

![Search box image](/docs/images/evhub-use-part1-h2.png)

You can also search _within a tab_ to restrict results to just _Issues, Claims, Evidence,_ etc. For example searching just Issues:

## Browsing the Hub

Let’s see the different ways in which you encounter Evidence Hub content. If you go to say the Issue tab, and browse one of the most connected Issues, by clicking on the name of the issue, e.g.:

![menu icon image](/docs/images/evhub-use-part1-k.png) 

It will take you to the _explore page_ for that issue. All entries in the Evidence Hub have an explore page. The default view when you open an explore page is known as the _Widget view_ (an example of which we saw above when exploring a theme). 

If you click the tree style logo ![menu icon image](/docs/images/evhub-use-part1-k1.png), you will get a linear view of the connections between the data for that Issue or data type entry, e.g.:

![Clain menu screen grab](/docs/images/evhub-use-part1-l.png)

If you click the network style logo ![menu icon image](/docs/images/evhub-use-part1-l0.png), you will get a network view of the connections between the data for that Issue or data type entry e.g.:

![Example tree outline image](/docs/images/evhub-use-part1-l2.png)

If you click the chat style logo ![menu icon image](/docs/images/evhub-use-part1-m1.png), you will get a chat space for a given Issue or data type entry, that allows community discussion around that entry e.g.:
